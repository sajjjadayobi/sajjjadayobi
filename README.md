# Hi, I’m Sajjad Ayoubi 👋
At 24, I serve as the AI Advisor at Divar.ir, the Iran's largest classified advertising platform. I'm passionate about applying artificial intelligence to solve challenging real-world problems and specialize in developing products that effectively leverage AI technology to deliver meaningful solutions.

About: I became fascinated with coding as a teenager, enjoying how it allowed me to construct things and learn from failures without significant cost. This led me to teach myself through resources like YouTube, where I learned not just programming but also English, AI, etc. I believe in the power of small, daily improvements with books, blogs and videos. I’m also intrested in psychology, decision making and neuroscience or anything related to human nature. Writing helps me to process what I’ve learned and to share insights with others. I write knowlege docs, personal and life docs and many other things 😃
